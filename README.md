# Arduino Clone (ATmega32u4) - USB MIDI Breath Controller

On the Arduino I am using a pressure sensor to get Breath Pressure readings and a potentiometer to manually set the range to callibrate to air-flow intensity. The breathing tube is split with one end connected to the sensor and the other passing air to enable breath-tru response like traditional wind instruments. 


## Requirements

- Arduino or equivalent with ATmega32u4 Chip (or possibly boards with the 16u2 USB microcontroller) To enable operation as a standard USB midi device out of the box.

- [MIDIUSB](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/MIDIUSB) Library
